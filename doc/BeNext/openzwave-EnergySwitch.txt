The EnergySwitch configuration in the openzwave project does not contain
all available configuration parameters. There was a pull request at some
point to have the config file updated, but that one somehow didn't make
it. See: https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/pull/1501

To fix things locally, copy the openzwave-EnergySwitch.xml from this directory
to the ozw_config directory. I do this using the following shell commands:

  DST=$(find /srv/homeassistant/lib | grep BeNext/EnergySwitch.xml$)
  cp openzwave-EnergySwitch.xml $DST

I restart Home Assistant after this (not sure if it is needed). Now, new
Energy Switch devices will be created using all available config options.
Existing devices have to be removed and added back to have the extra options
included.
