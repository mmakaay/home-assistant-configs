# A templated sensor, used to provide a derived state for the coffee machine.
# The coffee machine has a FIBARO switch built into it, and that switch reports
# power usage. Based on the power usage, a state can be derived:
#
# - no power : the machine is off
# - around 1400W : water is being cooked
# - around 60W : only the hot plate is active, so the coffee is ready
#
# For a description of my FIBARO / coffee machine hack, take look at:
