# This script is used to turn on a scene and cancel timers for
# automatic lighting in the area. This script is used, because there
# is no event available for turning on a scene. Otherwise I could
# have reacted to that event to turn off timers. 
#
# Prerequisite for using this script is that the area has the expected
# timers defined:
#
# - timer.{{ area }}
# - timer.{{ area }}_cooldown
